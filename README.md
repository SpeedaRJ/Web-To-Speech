# Web-To-Speech

Even if called web to speech, this pet project offers a bit more.  

It's a tool to be used through the command line, that allows you to:
- Parse a web page into some text.
- Summarize the text.
- Save the text into a `pdf` file.
- Generate an audio file from it.
- Save the audio file into a `wav` file.
- Automatically play the generated audio file.

Each step of the process is packaged into it's own separate module, inside the `core` directory. 

Feel free to use them as you wish.
